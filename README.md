# PCA-in-R
Use made-up data, pretend it's genomes, then start by using prcomp() for a Principal Component Analysis (PCA) on the data. Following this, replicate the same thing using svd() followed by eigen(), to see if the results are the same. Run the code and you will see that the 3 different approaches all arrive at the same results.
